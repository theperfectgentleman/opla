## **🔄 Resuming Work After Context Loss**

**If you're coming back to this project:**

1. **Read:** `Backend-Studio Development Roadmap.md` → "TL;DR - Quick Start" section
2. **Check:** `DEVELOPMENT_CHECKLIST.md` → See what's been completed
3. **Review:** Last few commits in git to see recent changes
4. **Refer:** Quick Reference sections in the Roadmap for schema, tech stack, etc.
5. **Continue:** Pick up at the next unchecked task in the checklist

---

## **📝 Key Principles (Don't Forget)**

1. **Blueprint-Driven:** Forms are defined by JSON (see `Form Blueprint.md`)
2. **Draft vs Live:** Forms have two versions - editable draft and published live
3. **Offline-First:** Mobile app syncs data, doesn't query API directly
4. **PostgreSQL Only:** Using JSONB for flexible schema (no MongoDB)
5. **Access Control:** Role-based (collector/analyst/editor) + org-based (admin/member)

---

## **✅ What's Been Done (Initial Setup)**

- ✅ Project structure created (monorepo + backend folders)
- ✅ FastAPI backend scaffolded
- ✅ Alembic configured for migrations
- ✅ TurboRepo frontend with Studio and Mobile apps
- ✅ All documentation completed

**Next Step:** Begin Phase 1 (Authentication) from the Roadmap
